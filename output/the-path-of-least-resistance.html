<p>When was the last time that anyone told you that you can be world class at something?And by something I mean something like, communication, project management, team management or training or relationship building. And I am sure that when you were told this, you were also told that if you work hard on fixing your weaknesses or areas of improvement you could become truly world class.  </p>
<p>What if I told you that, it is possible for you to become great at something, and it is not achieved by fixing your weaknesses. </p>
<p>Now, you may ask: What is that something that I can be world class at?</p>
<p>Or you may say: I know that I am good at resolving conflicts but I don’t know about being world class at it.</p>
<p>There are two parts to what I am trying to say. The first part is that you can become great, amazing, really awesome at something. The second part is that, there exists this thing that you can really excel at. </p>
<h2>Part One</h2>
<p>Let’s look at part one first. The part where I am saying that YOU can become great at doing something. </p>
<p>All of us humans are gifted with our own unique set of talents, skills, motivations and strengths. A lot of research has gone into trying to name, identify and define the talents that people can have and possess. This means that all of us have these talents or strengths. </p>
<p>What sets each one of us apart is the proportion of each of these identified talents that are unique to each one of us. </p>
<p>Consider this, if carrots, tomatoes and lemons could be used to make a glass of juice, you could make a glass of juice with the three ingredients used in the following proportions: 
Option One:
70 % Carrots
25 % Tomatoes
5 % Lemons</p>
<p>Option Two:
60 % Tomatoes
10 % Lemons
30 % Carrots</p>
<p>The same three ingredients can come together in different proportions to taste very different in each case. </p>
<p>Along the same lines, you have been gifted with a set of talents or strengths in certain proportions. If you arrange them in the order of the largest proportion to the smallest proportion you get your unique talent or strengths profile. </p>
<p>How is this strengths profile useful to you? What do you do with it? What is its significance?  </p>
<p>Imagine a potent stream of water, this potent stream of water is rolling down a hill through a forest. On it’s way down the hill, the water always takes the path of least resistance. It never stops, if it encounters a rock or tree in its way, the water flows around it. It always keep rolling down hill. </p>
<p>Your talent or strengths profile shows you your path of least resistance, and if you focus on taking this path of least resistance you will get much further ahead in life than if you took a path where you focus on your trying to fix your weaknesses or in other words a path of high resistance or even moderate resistance. </p>
<p>So by identifying YOUR path of least resistance YOU can become great at doing something.</p>
<h2>Part Two</h2>
<p>Now, let us look at what is this something that you can be great at. </p>
<p>A fish is great at swimming, a monkey is amazing at climbing trees, an elephant is awesome at stomping through a bush and flattening it to the ground and a horse is the best at travelling long distances at high speeds. </p>
<p>Each of these animals have been given bodies by nature that allow them to be great at each of things they do. Each of these animals face the least resistance in what they do the best. </p>
<p>Becoming aware of the gifts that you have been given by nature will help you identify what is the thing that you will face the least resistance on your way to becoming great at it. </p>
<p>Your talent or strength profile can help you to identify what is the thing that you are naturally gifted to succeed at without much resistance. </p>
<p>Coincidentally, taking this path of least resistance is also known to be the path that leads to the most happiness and satisfaction that you can get from life. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is how, it is possible for you to become great at something, something that is unique to you and it is achieved in your own unique way. It is achieved by focusing on your natural gifts, your natural talents and strengths that you were born with.  </p>

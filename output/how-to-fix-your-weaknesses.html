<p>The best way to fix your weaknesses, is to stop trying to fix your weaknesses, and start looking past them. Let us assume that one way or another you discovered your innate talents or strengths. And you now have in your hand a list of talents sorted in the order of their dominance in your personality. If we consider the Clifton Strengths model then you will have 34 talents in your talents / strengths report. These talents will be ordered according to their proportions in your personality. Highest to lowest. That would be your personal strengths profile. </p>
<p>Let me talk about why it is highly inefficient to work on improving your low proportion strengths. According to Gallup a talent is not a strength on its own. If you put efforts into improving your skills that align with your talents then it becomes a strength. There is a nifty formula to illustrate this. </p>
<p>Strength equals talent multiplied by skill. Now let us assume the talents and skill level to be on a scale of 1 to 10. Consider a talent that you have which exists within you at a magnitude of 3 of 10 and if you work hard and take your skill level for this particular talent to say 7 of 10. Then the magnitude of strength will be 3 multiplied by 7 which is 21. 
On the other hand, if you were to improve your skills to a skill level of 7 for a talent that is of the magnitude 8 then you strength would be 8 multiplied by 7 which would be 56. Which means that return on improving your skills in an area that you are highly talented in is much higher than putting any effort in improving your skills in a low talent area. </p>
<p>And that is why it is highly inefficient to try to fix your bottom of the list talents. In other words, do not waste time fixing your weaknesses. Life is short. Instead focus on building on your strengths. You are perfect just the way you are, and your strengths can help you build a vision for your life that can make you happy and keep you happy.  </p>
<p>Now, there will be many situations where the task at hand will need you to use one of your top talents and that is when you will shine bright and be awesome. There may also be many situations where the task at hand will need you to use one of your middle of the list, or bottom of the list talents. You might be wondering what is one to do in those situations? How does one come on top when the situation calls for you to use one of your talents that is not in your top 5 or top 10? </p>
<h2>Two Strategies</h2>
<p>There are two strategies that you can use to deal with situations where you need to use one of your not so super talents. </p>
<h3>Strategy No. 1: Use your top talents to handle the situation</h3>
<p>Imagine a situation where you need to teach a bunch of people a new skill. Typically people with Learner talent are excellent at teaching and training. But if Learner was not one of your top talents, but say Communication and Adaptability were your top strengths. In that case you could use your Adaptability to change directions and learn the new skill and then use your Communication talent to deliver the training. </p>
<p>To be able to effectively do this you will need to get very familiar with each of your talents - (both the top of the list talents and the bottom of the list talents) - this will help you know which of your top talents can be used to achieve any goal. </p>
<h3>Strategy No. 2: Just do your best</h3>
<p>For those situations that need a particular talent to be high, but for you it is one of the not so high talents, in that case, just do what you can and don’t worry too much about it. There will be numerous other activities that you will be amazing at because they align with your top talents. The key objective here is to not anything get you down. The key is to know that you may not shine at everything that you do, but where you do shine you shine the brightest. 
The Problem of Too Much
There is a scenario where the strongest of your talents can cause trouble for you. Our strengths are like powerful tools in our toolbox. Let us say that one of the tools that you had in your toolbox was a superbly balanced ergonomic hammer. When you use your hammer with just the right amount of force to drive nails into a stud in the wall you hear the almost musical thump of the nail lodging itself into the stud. But if you use too much force or too little force, your hammer may not be living up to its potential. </p>
<p>Similarly, if you see yourself using a talent in a way that is not suitable for a given situation, then it may lead to undesirable results. While you are learning to develop your talents into strengths you will need to watch out and use your talents judiciously. </p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>You need to know that you are made up of strengths and not weaknesses. You can get ahead in life by making use of the talents that are strong within you to achieve your goals. In situations that demand the use of your bottom-of-the-list talents, lean in and do your best. Be judicious with the use of your talents and use just the right amount of talent as the situation demands. </p>

&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix your weaknesses, is to stop trying to fix your weaknesses, and start looking past them. Let us assume that one way or another you discovered your innate talents or strengths. And you now have in your hand a list of talents sorted in the order of their dominance in your personality. If we consider the Clifton Strengths model then you will have 34 talents in your talents / strengths report. These talents will be ordered according to their proportions in your personality. Highest to lowest. That would be your personal strengths profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me talk about why it is highly inefficient to work on improving your low proportion strengths. According to Gallup a talent is not a strength on its own. If you put efforts into improving your skills that align with your talents then it becomes a strength. There is a nifty formula to illustrate this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength equals talent multiplied by skill. Now let us assume the talents and skill level to be on a scale of 1 to 10. Consider a talent that you have which exists within you at a magnitude of 3 of 10 and if you work hard and take your skill level for this particular talent to say 7 of 10. Then the magnitude of strength will be 3 multiplied by 7 which is 21. 
On the other hand, if you were to improve your skills to a skill level of 7 for a talent that is of the magnitude 8 then you strength would be 8 multiplied by 7 which would be 56. Which means that return on improving your skills in an area that you are highly talented in is much higher than putting any effort in improving your skills in a low talent area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is why it is highly inefficient to try to fix your bottom of the list talents. In other words, do not waste time fixing your weaknesses. Life is short. Instead focus on building on your strengths. You are perfect just the way you are, and your strengths can help you build a vision for your life that can make you happy and keep you happy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there will be many situations where the task at hand will need you to use one of your top talents and that is when you will shine bright and be awesome. There may also be many situations where the task at hand will need you to use one of your middle of the list, or bottom of the list talents. You might be wondering what is one to do in those situations? How does one come on top when the situation calls for you to use one of your talents that is not in your top 5 or top 10? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two strategies that you can use to deal with situations where you need to use one of your not so super talents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategy No. 1: Use your top talents to handle the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a situation where you need to teach a bunch of people a new skill. Typically people with Learner talent are excellent at teaching and training. But if Learner was not one of your top talents, but say Communication and Adaptability were your top strengths. In that case you could use your Adaptability to change directions and learn the new skill and then use your Communication talent to deliver the training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to effectively do this you will need to get very familiar with each of your talents - (both the top of the list talents and the bottom of the list talents) - this will help you know which of your top talents can be used to achieve any goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategy No. 2: Just do your best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those situations that need a particular talent to be high, but for you it is one of the not so high talents, in that case, just do what you can and don’t worry too much about it. There will be numerous other activities that you will be amazing at because they align with your top talents. The key objective here is to not anything get you down. The key is to know that you may not shine at everything that you do, but where you do shine you shine the brightest. 
The Problem of Too Much
There is a scenario where the strongest of your talents can cause trouble for you. Our strengths are like powerful tools in our toolbox. Let us say that one of the tools that you had in your toolbox was a superbly balanced ergonomic hammer. When you use your hammer with just the right amount of force to drive nails into a stud in the wall you hear the almost musical thump of the nail lodging itself into the stud. But if you use too much force or too little force, your hammer may not be living up to its potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you see yourself using a talent in a way that is not suitable for a given situation, then it may lead to undesirable results. While you are learning to develop your talents into strengths you will need to watch out and use your talents judiciously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to know that you are made up of strengths and not weaknesses. You can get ahead in life by making use of the talents that are strong within you to achieve your goals. In situations that demand the use of your bottom-of-the-list talents, lean in and do your best. Be judicious with the use of your talents and use just the right amount of talent as the situation demands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I talk about how to learn about your strengths. Once you know your strengths, you can then build a life vision for yourself around your strengths, to help you navigate your life in the coming days. I will also touch up on why I think it is difficult to identify or recognize your strengths without your biases getting in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 Ways to Identify and Recognise Your Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think hard and name your strengths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your peers / family / friends / colleagues to name your strengths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a trip down memory lane and try to remember all the times that you experienced flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one or more strengths assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now elaborate on each of the four methods that I just mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1 - Think Hard and Name Your Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit down on a comfortable chair with a pen and notepad. Keep your favourite hot beverage beside you and take a sip. Keep the beverage down, and before you pick it back up to take another sip write one of your strengths on the paper. Do this until your beverage cup is empty or you have a list of 5 to 10 strengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, rearrange the strengths you have listed on the paper in a descending order of their magnitude of strength, and voila, your self assessed strengths profile is ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are doing the exercise, something to watch out for is what I would call aspirational strengths. Based on our deepest desires, all of us secretly wish we had certain strengths. While you are writing down your strengths it is very easy to start listing your aspirational strengths as your self assessed strengths. Do not let your aspirational strengths sneak into the list of your self assessed strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 - Ask People Who Know You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next method of finding out what your strengths are is to ask those who know you well. Ask each person that knows you well to name 5 of your strengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask around 5 to 10 people. You can ask your family members, your spouse, your parents, your colleagues, your boss, your friends. This will give you a big list and if one or more strengths are common from the multiple lists of strengths that you will end up with, then you would have found the strongest of your strengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as before, arrange all the strengths that you have been recognised to have in the order of the number of times they repeat, highest to lowest and you would have your peer assessed strengths profile ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is something to watch out for. Many decades of pathological psychology having a strong influence on education, work culture, parenting and everything in between has made it difficult for people in general to focus on anything positive and so the people that you ask to tell you strengths may find it hard to do so and thus may tell you your areas of improvements rather than the areas where you are a natural star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3 - Take a Trip Down Memory Lane to Recollect Your Experiences of Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experience of flow is one when you lose all track of time when doing something. You getting involved in what you are doing so much that everything outside of what you are doing goes out of focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, flow happens when what you are doing aligns completely with your strengths or is congruous to your personality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a list of these experiences as they have occurred in the past will help you identify your strengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential problem with this method could be that if you are not familiar with the concept of flow you may find it hard to recognise its occurrence in your past. Or it could be you might have just forgotten about the occurrence of flow that may have happened last month, last year or even earlier than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4 - Take a Scientifically Designed Strengths Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of recording this podcast, I know of two strengths assessments models that I have personally experienced and reviewed the results of. And I found the results of these assessments meaningful and useful in deciding what I wanted to do with my career and life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is CliftonStrengths Assessment and the second one is Values in Action Character Strengths Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these strengths models are based on positive psychology which focuses on helping people develop or find meaning in life using their strengths and is the opposite of pathological psychology that focuses on treating mental illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these assessments help you identify your personal and character strengths and the results provide recommendations on how to use your strengths on your way to become your best self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally found the #4 method of using scientific strengths assessments to be most useful and it helped me overcome some of the problems that might get in your way when using the other methods. And I want to say that irrespective of the method you use to identify and recognise your strengths, if you shift your focus from trying to fix your weaknesses to building strengths, you can go much much farther in life towards achieving a meaningful life for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time that anyone told you that you can be world class at something?And by something I mean something like, communication, project management, team management or training or relationship building.

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time that anyone told you that you can be world class at something?And by something I mean something like, communication, project management, team management or training or relationship building. And I am sure that when you were told this, you were also told that if you work hard on fixing your weaknesses or areas of improvement you could become truly world class.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that, it is possible for you to become great at something, and it is not achieved by fixing your weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may ask: What is that something that I can be world class at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you may say: I know that I am good at resolving conflicts but I don’t know about being world class at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to what I am trying to say. The first part is that you can become great, amazing, really awesome at something. The second part is that, there exists this thing that you can really excel at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at part one first. The part where I am saying that YOU can become great at doing something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us humans are gifted with our own unique set of talents, skills, motivations and strengths. A lot of research has gone into trying to name, identify and define the talents that people can have and possess. This means that all of us have these talents or strengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets each one of us apart is the proportion of each of these identified talents that are unique to each one of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this, if carrots, tomatoes and lemons could be used to make a glass of juice, you could make a glass of juice with the three ingredients used in the following proportions: 
Option One:
70 % Carrots
25 % Tomatoes
5 % Lemons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option Two:
60 % Tomatoes
10 % Lemons
30 % Carrots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same three ingredients can come together in different proportions to taste very different in each case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, you have been gifted with a set of talents or strengths in certain proportions. If you arrange them in the order of the largest proportion to the smallest proportion you get your unique talent or strengths profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this strengths profile useful to you? What do you do with it? What is its significance?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a potent stream of water, this potent stream of water is rolling down a hill through a forest. On it’s way down the hill, the water always takes the path of least resistance. It never stops, if it encounters a rock or tree in its way, the water flows around it. It always keep rolling down hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your talent or strengths profile shows you your path of least resistance, and if you focus on taking this path of least resistance you will get much further ahead in life than if you took a path where you focus on your trying to fix your weaknesses or in other words a path of high resistance or even moderate resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by identifying YOUR path of least resistance YOU can become great at doing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part Two&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us look at what is this something that you can be great at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fish is great at swimming, a monkey is amazing at climbing trees, an elephant is awesome at stomping through a bush and flattening it to the ground and a horse is the best at travelling long distances at high speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these animals have been given bodies by nature that allow them to be great at each of things they do. Each of these animals face the least resistance in what they do the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of the gifts that you have been given by nature will help you identify what is the thing that you will face the least resistance on your way to becoming great at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your talent or strength profile can help you to identify what is the thing that you are naturally gifted to succeed at without much resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, taking this path of least resistance is also known to be the path that leads to the most happiness and satisfaction that you can get from life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how, it is possible for you to become great at something, something that is unique to you and it is achieved in your own unique way. It is achieved by focusing on your natural gifts, your natural talents and strengths that you were born with.  &lt;/p&gt;

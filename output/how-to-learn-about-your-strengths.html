<p>In this episode, I talk about how to learn about your strengths. Once you know your strengths, you can then build a life vision for yourself around your strengths, to help you navigate your life in the coming days. I will also touch up on why I think it is difficult to identify or recognize your strengths without your biases getting in the way. </p>
<h2>4 Ways to Identify and Recognise Your Strengths</h2>
<h1>1 - Think hard and name your strengths</h1>
<h1>2 - Ask your peers / family / friends / colleagues to name your strengths</h1>
<h1>3 - Take a trip down memory lane and try to remember all the times that you experienced flow</h1>
<h1>4 - Take one or more strengths assessments</h1>
<p>I will now elaborate on each of the four methods that I just mentioned. </p>
<h3>1 - Think Hard and Name Your Strengths</h3>
<p>Sit down on a comfortable chair with a pen and notepad. Keep your favourite hot beverage beside you and take a sip. Keep the beverage down, and before you pick it back up to take another sip write one of your strengths on the paper. Do this until your beverage cup is empty or you have a list of 5 to 10 strengths. </p>
<p>Now, rearrange the strengths you have listed on the paper in a descending order of their magnitude of strength, and voila, your self assessed strengths profile is ready. </p>
<p>While you are doing the exercise, something to watch out for is what I would call aspirational strengths. Based on our deepest desires, all of us secretly wish we had certain strengths. While you are writing down your strengths it is very easy to start listing your aspirational strengths as your self assessed strengths. Do not let your aspirational strengths sneak into the list of your self assessed strengths.</p>
<h3>2 - Ask People Who Know You</h3>
<p>The next method of finding out what your strengths are is to ask those who know you well. Ask each person that knows you well to name 5 of your strengths. </p>
<p>Ask around 5 to 10 people. You can ask your family members, your spouse, your parents, your colleagues, your boss, your friends. This will give you a big list and if one or more strengths are common from the multiple lists of strengths that you will end up with, then you would have found the strongest of your strengths. </p>
<p>Same as before, arrange all the strengths that you have been recognised to have in the order of the number of times they repeat, highest to lowest and you would have your peer assessed strengths profile ready. </p>
<p>Now, there is something to watch out for. Many decades of pathological psychology having a strong influence on education, work culture, parenting and everything in between has made it difficult for people in general to focus on anything positive and so the people that you ask to tell you strengths may find it hard to do so and thus may tell you your areas of improvements rather than the areas where you are a natural star. </p>
<h3>3 - Take a Trip Down Memory Lane to Recollect Your Experiences of Flow</h3>
<p>An experience of flow is one when you lose all track of time when doing something. You getting involved in what you are doing so much that everything outside of what you are doing goes out of focus. </p>
<p>Most commonly, flow happens when what you are doing aligns completely with your strengths or is congruous to your personality. </p>
<p>Making a list of these experiences as they have occurred in the past will help you identify your strengths. </p>
<p>One potential problem with this method could be that if you are not familiar with the concept of flow you may find it hard to recognise its occurrence in your past. Or it could be you might have just forgotten about the occurrence of flow that may have happened last month, last year or even earlier than that. </p>
<h3>4 - Take a Scientifically Designed Strengths Assessment</h3>
<p>At the time of recording this podcast, I know of two strengths assessments models that I have personally experienced and reviewed the results of. And I found the results of these assessments meaningful and useful in deciding what I wanted to do with my career and life. </p>
<p>The first one is CliftonStrengths Assessment and the second one is Values in Action Character Strengths Survey.</p>
<p>Both of these strengths models are based on positive psychology which focuses on helping people develop or find meaning in life using their strengths and is the opposite of pathological psychology that focuses on treating mental illnesses. </p>
<p>Both of these assessments help you identify your personal and character strengths and the results provide recommendations on how to use your strengths on your way to become your best self. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I personally found the #4 method of using scientific strengths assessments to be most useful and it helped me overcome some of the problems that might get in your way when using the other methods. And I want to say that irrespective of the method you use to identify and recognise your strengths, if you shift your focus from trying to fix your weaknesses to building strengths, you can go much much farther in life towards achieving a meaningful life for yourself. </p>
